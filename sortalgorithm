1. Bubble sort
   - Average and worst case time complexity is n^2 when the array is reverse sorted
   - Best case time complexity is n when array is already sorted

2. Selection sort
   Best, average and worst case time complexity is n^2 which is dependent of distribution of data
   
3. Merge sort
   Best, average and worst case time complexity is nlogn which is dependent of distribution of data
   
4. Heap sort
   Best, average and worst case time complexity is nlogn which is dependent of distribution of data
